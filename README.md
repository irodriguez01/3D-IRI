# 3D-IRI
3D IRI data representation

This project is creating a dynamic way to visualize data from SmartEagle (SE) that is Japanese technology used for
pavement scanning.

SE give us High Resolution Images and precise GPS data about the longitudinal profile in roads to identify IRI
(Internatinal Roughness Index)
